Currently I am working on building a few applications for my own needs, which I will certainly show on my profile. Here are some of the ideas:
ðŸ”­ <b>Link manager - NET Core MVC </b>- for storing resources in a clean and organized way.
ðŸ”­ <b>Playlist creator - Razor Pages or MVC</b> application which will use API's of popular music services for creating playlists.
