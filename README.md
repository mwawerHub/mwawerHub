<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Marcin</h1>
<h3 align="center">Self-taught .NET Developer</h3>

<p align="center">
I started my adventure with programming in MS Excel. Simple macros, then user forms, and finally fully automated tools for the manufacturing industry. I was getting better and better. Finally, it turned out that I Excel at Excel ðŸ˜‰.
I love spreadsheets and VBA, but it turns out that it is not enough for my programming ambitions. I decided that it was time to reach for more and so I hit the path of development in .Net technologies.
